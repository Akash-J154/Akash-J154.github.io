Hi, I'm Akash, currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), under the guidance of Prof. [Charu Sharma](https://charusharma.org/). My research is centered around computer vision, particularly in the 3D domain, where I have worked on scene understanding and reconstruction, alongside exploring diffusion models and knowledge distillation techniques.

In addition to my current academic work, I had the opportunity to intern with Prof. [Ramanathan Muthuganapathy](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) at the [Advanced Geometric Computing Lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html), IIT Madras, where I worked on 2D sketch analysis and inpainting techniques.
